# Weather Weight

Weather Weight is a lightweight weather app for Android. It uses Yahoo's
weather API.

Reasons for developing:
* Popular weather apps I tried were on the heavy side with respect to features
  and resource usage, and I wanted something lighter
* I wanted to try building an Android app with some common libraries and
  practices; as a result, some libraries and approaches used might be overkill
  for this app
